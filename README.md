# Neural-Network

A fully connected neural network package.

The aim of this repository was to gain a more indepth understanding of fully connected neural networks, and the backpropagation algorithm. This package contains the functionality to create neural networks with any number of nodes and layers, with a range of activation and loss functions. 

Activation functions
* ReLU
* Sigmoid
* Tanh

Loss functions
* Mean Squared Error

More activation and loss functions could be added in future however this is only an educational project and this would provide no additional value.
